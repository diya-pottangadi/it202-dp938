<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Make sure you have the dev/prod branches created before starting this assignment.</p><p><strong>Template Files</strong>&nbsp;You can find all 3 template files in this gist:&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/MattToegel/48b48377eaa1937c886b7840c449750a">https://gist.github.com/MattToegel/48b48377eaa1937c886b7840c449750a</a><br></p><p>Setup steps:</p><ol><li><code>git checkout dev</code></li><li><code>git pull origin dev</code></li><li><code>git checkout -b M2-PHP-HW</code></li></ol><p>You'll have 3 problems to save for this assignment.</p><p>Each problem you're given a template&nbsp;<strong>Do not edit anything in the template except where the comments tell you to</strong>.</p><p>The templates are done in such a way to make it easier to capture the output in a screenshot (if it's still not able to fit well, you can zoom out in your browser).</p><p>You'll copy each template into their own separate .php files, immediately git add, git commit these files (you can do it together) so we can capture the difference/changes between the templates and your additions. This part is required for full credit.</p><p>HW steps:</p><ol><li>Open VS Code at the root of your repository folder (you should see the Procfile and all from the Heroku setup)</li><li>In VS Code create a new folder/directory in public_html called M2</li><li>Create 3 new files in this new M2 folder (problem1.php, problem2.php, problem3.php)</li><li>Paste each template into their respective files</li><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m "adding template baselines</code></li><li>Do the related work (you may do steps 8 and 9 as often as needed or you can do it all at once at the end)</li><li><code>git add .</code></li><li><code>git commit -m "completed hw"</code></li><li>When you're done push the branch<ol><li><code>git push origin M2-PHP-HW</code></li></ol></li><li>Go to heroku dev, and manually deploy the M2-PHP-HW branch</li><li>After it deploys go to&nbsp;<a href="https://ucid-dev.herokuapp.com/M2/problem1.php">https://ucid-dev.herokuapp.com/M2/problem1.php</a>&nbsp;(replace ucid with your ucid if you followed the setup instructions)</li><li>Update the URL to check that each problem file displays properly</li><li>Create the Pull Request with&nbsp;<strong>dev</strong>&nbsp;as base and&nbsp;<strong>M2-PHP-HW</strong>&nbsp;as compare</li><li>Create a new file in the M2 folder in VS Code called m2_submission.md</li><li>Fill out the below deliverable items, save the submission, and copy to markdown<ol><li>For this assignment you may get screenshots from your heroku dev instance, you do not need to move it to prod then come back and update it</li></ol></li><li>Paste the markdown into the m2_submission.md</li><li>add/commit/push the md file<ol><li><code>git add m2_submission.md</code></li><li><code>git commit -m "adding submission file"</code></li><li><code>git push origin M2-PHP-HW</code></li></ol></li><li>Merge the pull request from step 14</li><li>Create a new pull request with prod as base and dev as compare</li><li>Immediately create/merge/confirm, this is just to deploy it to prod and you don't need to adjust anything during this step</li><li>On your local machine sync the changes<ol><li><code>git checkout dev</code></li><li><code>git pull origin dev</code></li></ol></li><li>Submit the link to the m2_submission.md file from the prod branch to Canvas</li></ol><p><br></p></td></tr></table>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I&#39;m familiar with other languages, but not so much with PHP. However, I<br>already knew how to use if statements and modulus to find odd numbers.<br>Since we went over the loop during class, I wrote the if statement<br>and printed it using echo. For aesthetic appearances, I made sure there was<br>a space between each output by looking it up on W3Schools.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Using the same loop statement from problem 1,&nbsp; I used the $total variable<br>and incremented the local variable we created to $total inside the loop. Then,<br>I used W3Schools to learn about the round function and how to round<br>it to 2 decimal points outside of the loop. One thing I was<br>confused about was how to round it to 2 decimal places if it<br>only ended in 1.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I learned about the absolute value function from W3Schools and implemented that inside<br>the same loop statement from problem 1 and 2. Then, I used the<br>var_dump to print both the data type as well as the positive output.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had a lot of issues originally. I had a lot of starting<br>anxiety because I&#39;ve never used VS code or GitHub before or worked in<br>actual web development. I got started by watching the submission video and learning<br>to copy the files that way. However, once I got there, I was<br>confused about what I even had to code, where, how to access the<br>output, how to write the code, and more.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>After a long time of procrastinating<br>and being scared and not knowing what to do, I realized that the<br>coding problems were written in comments and I just had to code. Furthermore,<br>I realized that the coding concepts given were really simple, and even though<br>I don&#39;t know PHP that well, I could just use W3Schools and other<br>resources to figure out the functions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once I got the code written down, I<br>had an issue with finding the output. Using the cheat sheet method with<br>localhost, I would get an error and the website would say access denied.<br>However, using the 127.0.01:5000/Folder/FolderName.php method worked and I was able to see the<br>output. Being able to get to this step was a huge relief because<br>I&#39;ve been struggling with seeing the output and finding the website, even during<br>class.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
